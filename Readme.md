# Delm Compiler

Delm-compiler is an **experimental** project trying to compile Elm to Solidity.

_Delm aka Decentralized Elm._

## Motivation

Both elm and solidity are amazing projects that are solving different problems.
* Elm enables developers to write safe code _for reliable webapps_;
* Solidity enables developers to write Smart Contracts _which governs the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state_.

Delm tries to leverage the best of both worlds.

`Type safe code in the blockchain`

* Elm-like architecture, to manage blockchain states;
* Elm type-inference to minimize (remove?) runtime errors;
* Leverage Elm and Solidity ecosystems, where possible;
* Solidity security and toolings;
* Elm debugging.
